# Command List
* The goal of this addon is allow the ability to add and modify command lists of characters. When downloading the mod, the character and moddingapi folder should be placed in the root directory of your game. (The Storm 4 folder)
* Video Tutorial TBD, but look at the 3ssy folder in the character to understand how this mod works. It's pretty easy to understand how to use this mod by copying the 3ssy folder in the same directory, but renaming it to another character such as 2nrt. The name and awakening files correspond to the names in base and awakening forms respectively. The combos and awacombos files correspond to the combo list in base and awakening forms of your character. These work similarly to ns4s files, there's some documentation at this link. https://github.com/zealottormunds/ns4moddingapi/wiki/%5B1%5D-Messages:-Replace-game-messages
