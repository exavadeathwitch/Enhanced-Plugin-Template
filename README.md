# Enhanced Plugin Template
Credit to Zealot Tormunds for being the originator of the plugin template and modding api. Please check out his work in the link below.

In order to better use this tool for mod creation, I am enhancing the template with some other libraries and code.

Such libraries include:
* Minhook

All of my plugins are in separate branches in this repository, check those for tutorials, documentation, and download links.
