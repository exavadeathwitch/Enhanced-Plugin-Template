# Susanoo Jump Fix
* The goal of this addon is to fix a bug when porting non storm 4 susanoo awakenings to added characters. The bug occurs when the character jumps in susanoo awakening, as the susanoo will jump in the air with the character. To enable this mod, the process is similar to specialcondparam. Read this tutorial before coming back. https://github.com/zealottormunds/ns4moddingapi/wiki/%5B3%5D-Characters:-Adding-special-conditions-to-characters

* The file to modify is called susanooCondParam. There are 4 conditions in the file, and you can add or remove as many as you want.

1: SSN_2ITC

2: SSN_2SSZ

3: SSN_3SSK

4: SSN_4SSI

* When adding the characode below the condition, it will treat the respective characoded character in awakening as the character with the condition above. Therefore when porting characters, do not rename the susanoo body and keep it as the name from the original game.
